# Explore SEP

This project visualized the SEP. It consists of:

A crawler, and the raw data from SEP, so you won't have to run it again.

An exporter, to export the crawled data to something readable to Gephi.

Visualizations, which are images made from Gehpi.

And lastly, in the root directory and web, it has what is required to display the graph on the website.

Note that crawling is explicitly allowed per the ToS on SEP.
